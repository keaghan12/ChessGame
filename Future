This file will summarize where I think this project will go in the future. 

The first step is completing the game and working out the bugs I have created. 
I am currently in the process of improving the code, and going back through to fix little mistakes I made. 
As I progress, I find issues that I caused previously that must be fixed. 

The current ;argest bug I am fixing right now involves the moves in a game. The system I had in place caused issues, and would reset things that they shouldnt. 
This prevented the game from being playable or fun, due to non-chess related issues. 

Whenever the player was in check, it would not prevent future illegal moves to be fixed. 
While there was a system in place, it was inefficient and had serious issues that need to be worked out. 

I also "Finished" the game without en passant. Silly mistake. 

Ideally, I could progress to implement something chess and machine learning based.
while this is way more complicated than I am ready for at the moment, I don't see a reason I shouldnt such ambitious long term goals. 

I also want to implement different features. It would be interesting to allow the player to choose between 5x5 boards and 8x8 boards, etc. 
It would be interesting to try to implement some more advanced chess features shown on chess.com such as fog of war, bughouse, etc. 

I don't have a timeline to work on this project.
