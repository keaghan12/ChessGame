# ChessGame

This project is a chess game built in pygame. 
I intend to get the game functional for 1 or 2 player chess. 

A main menu will be created. There will be other sub options. 

The game will include sound effects and background music. 
There will be an option to toggle sounds. 

The game will include optional time limits for each player and time increments. 
These will be manipulated through the main menu. 

Once the game is complete, I will look into creating a very simple chess AI. 
This AI will play against the user instead of the random move system.
